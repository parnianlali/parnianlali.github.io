**Bio**

I'm an Artificial Intelligence programmer and researcher graduated from [Isfahan University of Technology (IUT)](https://www.iut.ac.ir/en) in Physics and Electrical Engineering.

during my bachlor thesis I became familier with machine learning and then I found my interest
more and more on AI fields and in this regard studying physics has given me a unique perspective to better illuminate the subtle insights of Electrical and AI.

Since graduating I’ve focused on improving my computer science and AI skills, particularly in Reinforcement Learning, by completing several courses and working on projects that aim to contribute meaningfully to the field.

In this project, I explored wearable technologies and various types of sensors, with a special focus on fiber optic sensors, which have emerged as a powerful force in the wearable tech field. I then outlined the fundamental concepts and steps for implementing machine learning in wearable sensors, reviewed existing research in this area, and proposed solutions to address the challenges encountered.
