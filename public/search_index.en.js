this post we will take a look at how to setup Collabora Online on\na Nextcloud instance using NixOS, resulting in a compelling self-hosted\nalternative to Google Docs/Sheets/Slides/Drawings.\n\nWith Collabora Online (which is based on LibreOffice), you can add support for documents,\nspreadsheets, slideshows and drawings to Nextcloud through the\nNextcloud Office app, allowing those files to be opened directly\nin the browser.\nFurthermore, multiple users can edit the files simultaneously, just like you might be\nused to from Google’s offerings.\nPersonally, while I don’t use an office suite that often (I prefer the comfort of neovim),\nwhen I have to I usually use Google’s, so this has been something I have wanted to de-Google\nfor a while.\nRecently, and as part of NixOS 24.11, the highly requested\npackage and module for Collabora Online has been merged into nixpkgs, which makes\nit the perfect opportunity to finally install this in my Nextcloud instance.\n\n    \n  Two users on a Collabora Online document, one authenticated and the other a guest, showcasing multi-user concurrency capabilities\nHow It Works\nIt was not immediately clear to me how Collabora and Nextcloud would integrate with each\nother, especially when taking security into account.\nThere didn’t seem to exist any API keys or anything similar, and all tutorials I could find seemed\nto encourage exposing Collabora to the internet (or over a VPN, if you are using that for Nextcloud\nas well).\nThis left me with a few questions: who stores the documents? Can someone use my Collabora instance\nwithout being authenticated with Nextcloud? How does authentication even work (remember, no API keys are\nshared between Nextcloud and Collabora)?\nAfter a lot of research and some source code reading, I figured out (mostly) how it works.\nNextcloud and Collabora communicate using the WOPI protocol, first introduced by\nMicrosoft.\nIn this scenario, Nextcloud behaves as a WOPI Host, while Collabora behaves as a WOPI Client.\nThis was first unintuitive to me, but it now makes sense: after all, Nextcloud is storing\nthe files, while Collabora is just accessing them.\nWhen you open a file in Nextcloud, it gives you a token and tells you to go talk to Collabora.\nYour browser will then start the Collabora web application and give it the file URL and that\ntoken, which Collabora uses to fetch the file and display it on your browser.\nThere are no API keys whatsoever because all authentication happens client-side. Neat!\nThis behaviour is summarized in a sequence diagram in a post on the Nextcloud Forums,\nwhich could be worth a look if you are still confused.\nRegarding security considerations, Nextcloud and Collabora allow you to restrict\nwhich IP addresses and domains they talk to, respectively.\nThis means it is possible to limit Nextcloud to only accept WOPI Clients with a given IP\naddress, and Collabora to only open documents from a given WOPI Host, which resolves\nmy security concerns.\nFinally, when it comes to storage, everything happens on Nextcloud.\nNothing is stored on Collabora, so we don’t need to worry about backups or even persistence\n(in case you are using ephemeral root storage like me).\nDeploy Collabora with NixOS\nGiven that a module now exists, it is pretty straightforward to deploy Collabora on\na NixOS system:\n\nWe set some settings that can depend on your setup, but here’s the reasoning behind\nthem:\n\nsince we’ll be using a reverse proxy in front of Collabora, we don’t need it to\nhandle SSL connections, so we disable it with ssl.enable = false, but tell it\nother users/apps are still supposed to use SSL when connecting to it with ssl.termination = true;\nlikewise, since connections will only be happening through the reverse proxy and\nlocally (Nextcloud), Collabora only needs to listen on localhost;\nas previously mentioned, we set storage.wopi.host to restrict Collabora to only\nopen documents from our Nextcloud instance;\nwe set server_name so that Collabora always uses it in the URLs it responds with,\nwhich would otherwise be derived from the Host HTTP header.\nThis is needed because we will make Nextcloud use localhost to talk to Collabora,\nwhich then forwards some URLs to the user.\nWithout setting this option, those URLs would be https://[::1]:9980/..., which the\nuser wouldn’t be able to access.\n\nFor all other settings, we can use the defaults (the NixOS module automatically adds them),\nwhich includes an option to keep the admin console disabled.\nThen, we must setup a reverse proxy, to forward all requests to port 9980, including WebSockets.\nThis will depend on your setup, but most people are using NGINX, so here is an example config:\n\nAfter rebuilding your configuration, you can visit https://collabora.example.com/hosting/discovery\n(which should show an XML document) to ensure Collabora is working fine.\nIf so, congratulations, you are ready to move into the next step!\nIntegrating with Nextcloud\nIntegrating this with Nextcloud is also pretty straightforward, but it’s a bit more\ncumbersome to set the configuration options declaratively.\nFirstly, we need to install the Nextcloud Office app, also\nknown as richdocuments.\nIf you can’t be bothered to do this declaratively, it is as simple as going into Nextcloud,\nopening the Apps page, going to the “Office &amp; text” category and clicking the “Download and enable”\nbutton.\nBut if you are here, you probably want to use Nix to do this, and fortunately that’s not\na lot of work since it is packaged:\n\nThis is all that takes to install the app on Nextcloud, but now we need to configure it.\nAgain, this is entirely possible to do through the UI (under Administration settings -&gt; Office),\nbut I prefer to do this declaratively.\nThe underlying options seem to be poorly documented (or at least I could not find them),\nso I made a trip to the app’s source code to find them.\nHere are the relevant ones:\n\nwopi_url: URL that Nextcloud will use to connect to Collabora internally;\npublic_wopi_url: URL that the browser will use to connect to Collabora (must be publicly-accessible);\nwopi_allowlist: comma-separated list of IP addresses of WOPI clients to accept connections from.\n\nIt could be relevant to note that public_wopi_url cannot be set through the UI\n(at least that I could find), so you just have to use the public URL for wopi_url,\nif you are going that route.\nUnfortunately, these options are stored in the database, so we must set them up with occ.\nFor that reason, I’ve written a systemd unit that runs when Nextcloud and Collabora start\nand sets these options:\n\nAnother thing to note is that if you are deploying this on a machine with a public IP\naddress (e.g., a VPS), you can use 127.0.0.1 and ::1 for wopi_allowlist,\nbut that is not the case if you are behind NAT (which is my case).\nI could not find a way have Collabora connect through localhost to Nextcloud because\nNextcloud is not listening on any port but instead on a Unix socket that is then behind\na reverse proxy, so even tough the wopi_callback_url option exists, I could not use it.\nAdditionally, I did not want to hardcode my public IP address in the config\nbecause it could change in the future (it’s not a static IP address).\nFor that reason, the easiest solution seems to be to edit /etc/hosts to force\nCollabora to resolve nextcloud.diogotc.com to localhost:\n\nWith this, we can now keep the aforementioned IP addresses for wopi_allowlist.\nAfter this is done and another rebuild, you should see a green checkmark in the\nAdministration settings -&gt; Office page:\n\n    \n  Nextcloud settings showing that Collabora Online is reachable from Nextcloud\nIf needed, you can also take a look at the commit where I deployed\nthis on my server.\nProblems\nAlmost everything I tested seems to be working perfectly, which is awesome!\nBut unfortunately, a major feature seems to be broken at the moment: PDF export.\nThis seems to be a packaging issue and other people in the nixpkgs community\nhave pointed out that it is for them broken as well.\nIf you already have LibreOffice installed locally, it’s not a critical issue since you\ncan just download the file and export it there, but it’s rather annoying and\nwill hopefully be fixed soon.\nConclusion\nIn this post we’ve taken a look into how to setup Collabora Online in your\nNextcloud instance using NixOS, which, thanks to the amazing work of nixpkgs\nmaintainers, is very straightforward.\nI also hope you’ve learnt a bit more about how WOPI works instead of it being\njust ✨ magic ✨.\n\nUpdate 2025-05-21: The codeblock for the nextcloud-config-collabora systemd unit\nhas been updated to work on NixOS 25.05 given the credential handling changes.\nThe only change was making the unit run as root instead of as the nextcloud user.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/collabora-nextcloud-nixos/","title":"Installing Collabora Online on Nextcloud with NixOS"},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/hello-world/":{"body":"Hello world, welcome to my little corner of the internet!\nThis post marks the beginning of my blogging journey.\nYou might be thinking: what will this blog be about?\n\nThat’s a great question!

deployment from\nDocker to a native NixOS module, and how you can do the same.\n\nI’m going to preface this post by saying that my Immich Docker deployment\nwas already being managed by NixOS and therefore I was\nalready using the host’s PostgreSQL database, which makes this an easier\nmigration.\nIf you are migrating from a standard docker-compose Immich setup,\nconsider taking a look at Scrumplex’s excellent migration guide\ninstead, which is unfortunately only available as an open PR on nixpkgs\n(at the time of writing).\nAdditionally, all of the steps below were done on Immich 1.123.0, so\nthings might change on future versions.\nWhy?\nWhile the Docker setup worked, it was very slow (systemd-analyze blame was\nshowing the Immich container taking considerable time to start) and required me\nto perform manual updates every time a new Immich release came out.\nWith the Immich NixOS module, everything is now handled by nixpkgs maintainers\nand there’s very little maintenance (and configuration!) to do on my side.\nPreparation\nBefore proceeding, it is extremely advisable to perform backups of both the\ndatabase and the media library.\nAdditionally, while migrating data (and before running the backups), turn off\nthe Immich container(s).\nWith my setup, that could be done by stopping the respective systemd units:\n\nMigrating Configuration\nSince my setup was already handled by NixOS, some things were already configured.\nTherefore, my configuration changes consisted only of throwing away the container\nconfigurations and replacing them with the services.immich module:\n\nI was also able to throw away the database and redis configuration, since those\nare now handled by the Immich NixOS module.\nYou can find the full diff in this commit.\nMy setup also includes mounting some network shares, but that is out of the\nscope of this blog post.\nAfter rebuilding the configuration, stop Immich again so that we can proceed to\nmigrate the database:\n\nMigrating Database\nSince Immich stores file paths in the database, those are now outdated and\ndon’t point to the correct files.\nFor reference, the file paths in the database start with upload/... while\nmy mediaLocation is set to /persist/immich.\nThe approach in the aforementioned migration guide is to backup the database\nto a file and perform a find and replace search there, from upload/ to the\nnew media location path.\nHowever, since my database doesn’t need to be moved, I wanted to do the same\nwithout having to dump and restore it.\nTherefore, I took a look at the schema (and data) to find which columns store\nfile paths, listed below in the format table_name.column_name:\n\nasset_files.path\nassets.originalPath\nassets.encodedVideoPath\nassets.sidecarPath\nmove_history.oldPath\nmove_history.newPath\nperson.thumbnailPath\nusers.profileImagePath\n\nTaking advantage of PostgreSQL’s regexp_replace function, we can perform\na find and replace directly in the database by opening a shell:\n\n\nDon’t forget to change /persist/immich to your own media location.\nYou can now turn Immich back on with:\n\nConclusion\nIn this post, we took a look at migrating an existing Immich deployment from Docker\nto the NixOS module, assuming that the database is already being handled\nby NixOS.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/immich-docker-to-nixos/","title":"Migrating Immich from Docker to NixOS"},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/ist-to-kth/":{"body":"A little over a year ago, due to my own interests but also some\npeer pressure from my friends and family, I started thinking about the possibility\nof studying abroad, either for the whole master’s, or only for one or two semesters.\nThis is the story of all the twists and turns in my journey to end up studying\nin the MSc Cybersecurity at KTH, in Sweden.\nHow It Started\nDuring the summer break, some of my friends started discussing studying abroad.\nInitially, I was just reading the messages they were sending while they investigated the\nvarious universities they were interested in applying to, but eventually I started doing\nsome research myself.\nInterestingly enough, while KTH was mentioned at the time, I had not considered it\nas one of my choices, which mostly consisted of universities in the Netherlands.\nAs weeks came and went, I got drowned in assignments and pushed aside submitting\nany applications, mainly due to dreading the work involved with getting all the\nlegal paperwork necessary. Looking back, getting the required documents was not\nthat big of a headache all things considered (more on that later).\nAround October, some of my friends started considering doing Erasmus instead.\nIt was a very appealing proposition: I would still get the experience of studying and\nliving abroad (and moving out of my parent’s house), while enjoying a hassle free\napplication (it would be just a few clicks in my university’s website).\nGranted, it would not look as good on my CV as a full-blown master’s abroad, but it\nwould still be relevant.\nFurthermore, at the time I had considered doing it for two semesters and not just\none (and, as far as I was aware, it would be possible).\nFor this reason, I was mostly interested in doing Erasmus starting in the first\nsemester of my master’s, in order to avoid doing the thesis abroad.\nTaking into the account the available destination universities from previous years,\nI ended up picking UvAmsterdam, TU/Delft and TUMunich as my top choices.\nAgain, at this point, despite being one of the options, KTH was still not on my radar,\nmainly because of me never having heard of it.\nWhere It All Fell Apart\nWith everything already planned and ready for the Erasmus applications on the 3rd of\nJanuary of 2023, there was nothing to do but wait (and enjoy the deserved Christmas break!).\nAfter all, what could go wrong? A lot, it turns out.\nTo have the necessary context of what happened here, we need to go back to 2021,\nwhen a structural change of the programmes was introduced at my university,\nTécnico Lisboa (IST), called MEPP.\nAmongst other (controversial) changes, the 5 year bachelor’s + master’s programmes\nwere broken apart into 3 and 2 year programmes, respectively.\nPerhaps the most notable consequence was that students are no longer guaranteed\na spot on the master’s, and instead have to apply if they want to continue their\nstudies after the bachelor.\nYou might already see where this is going.\nEven though we had enrolled in the bachelor in 2020, before these changes were\nimplemented, and therefore had a guaranteed spot on the master’s due to the\ntransition, our eligibility to do Erasmus in the first semester was still dubious.\nWith this in mind, and knowing that the class one year older than us had had the\nsame problem the year prior, my friends and I decided to reach out to both the\nMobility Coordinator for our programme, as well as the Mobility and International\nCooperation Office (NMCI) at our school, well in advance (around October/November).\nAfter exposing our exact situation, and highlighting the problems from the year prior,\nthey both said we would be allowed to do what we were planning to.\nWhile my friend contacted the Mobility Coordinator by email, another friend and I went\nin person to NMCI to ask our questions, and ended up not having any record of\nthat conversation.\nOn the 3rd of January of 2023, all hell broke loose when the applications opened\nand were accompanied by a note published the day prior by the school, saying that\nhaving completed 30 ECTS of master-level courses would be required to apply.\nUpon hearing the news, we were, understandably, feeling angry, upset, betrayed,\nand a myriad of other emotions that no words could describe (I might be\nexaggerating a bit, but we were pretty mad).\nWe were clearly not the only ones, since there was an Erasmus Q&amp;A Zoom session\nhosted by NMCI a few days later, where other students also demanded to know why\nthey were not being allowed to apply.\nOn that same day, one of my friends just decided he was going to apply to KTH,\nas it was the closest deadline and there was no application fee (for EU students).\nAfter considering all my previous research, I promptly followed suit, with plans\nto apply to TU/Eindhoven and TUMunich if I did not get accepted, given their\napplication deadlines were after KTH’s results publication.\nAlso, I excluded both TU/Delft and UvAmsterdam from my list of options\nsince the former required that I did the GRE (a General Test, that would require\nfurther monetary investment and time) and the latter required a bachelor thesis,\nwhich we did not have at IST.\nThe Application Process: Speedrun Edition\nWith less than a month to go, two friends of mine and I started gathering all\nthe required documents.\nWhile the application itself (i.e., picking which programmes we were applying to)\nhad to be done by the 15th of January, documents could still be submitted until\nthe 1st of February.\nThe first step was to book an English exam.\nI opted for the IELTS Academic since one of my friends had already picked that\none and, more importantly, I would get the results before the end of the month.\nFor that reason, I booked the test for the 22nd of January and got the results\non the 26th.\nHowever, I was later made aware that taking the C2 Proficiency (CPE) exam at\nEnglish Exam Centre would have been cheaper, but I’m not sure if I could have\ngotten the results on time.\nThe second challenge was to get all the required legal documents from our\nuniversity, since IST’s Graduate Area (AG) is notorious for being slow.\nTherefore, on the 6th of January, my friend and I went to their office in\nperson and, after waiting 2 to 3h in the queue, we got information on\nwhat documents we needed to request and their cost.\n[ Note: the information below is subject to changes, so take it with a grain of\nsalt ]\nThere were four documents University Admissions, the website used to apply to\nany Swedish university, asked of us, considering that we were still in the last\nyear of our bachelor’s:\n\nA transcript with all courses completed to date, including their respective\ngrades (40€);\nA list of the courses we were already enrolled in (0€, since it was the first time);\nA declaration stating we were enrolled in the bachelor’s in that specific academic\nyear (0€, available to all students in the Fénix Drive at the beginning of the year);\nA declaration stating that we were in the last year of the bachelor’s and would\nfinish that same year if we completed all courses we were enrolled in (10€).\n\nI’m unsure if the last document is required, but that’s what the Graduate Area advised\nus to send.\nOne thing to note is that, while the University Admission’s website states that the documents\nmust be in Portuguese and then officially translated, we asked them and it turns\nout we can just submit the documents in English, which IST provides, so we did.\nAdditionally, since the first semester had not finished yet, the grades in the transcript\nwere only up to the second semester of the second year.\nFor future reference, to get these documents, one needs to fill out R01 - Requerimento Certidão\nas in the picture below, and send it to AG’s email address:\n\n    \n  R01 form filled out to get the required documents\nTo our surprise, we got the documents quite quickly, having submitted the\nrequest on the 6th and received them on the 12th.\nWith the bureaucratic stuff out of the way, we now needed to focus on the\nrecommendation and motivation letters.\nNow is where things will differ depending on the programme.\nBoth the MSc Cybersecurity and MSc Computer Science I applied to required two\nrecommendation letters, ideally one from a professional setting and another\nfrom an educational one.\nSince I worked at DSI (the Computer and Network Services at IST) at the time,\nI asked my direct supervisor for a letter.\nIf you are not lucky enough to have professional experience yet, I’m sure two\nacademic letters would be just fine as well.\nPicking a teacher to ask a recommendation letter was more complicated, but I\nended up asking the teacher of the Computer Networks course, which I was still\nattending at that date.\nOne thing to keep in mind while submitting these recommendation letters is that\nthey must have contact details of the referees’, such as their email, phone number\nand address (but you can probably get away with just the email), as well as their\nname and job title.\nLastly, we needed to write our motivation letters and our CV. This was obviously\nthe most personal part of the application, and while it was a bit of work, it was\neasy to do with the time we had left.\nAdditionally, KTH’s student blog has some tips for writing motivation letters,\nwhich guided us through it.\n\n    \n  List of submitted documents on University Admissions\nIn addition to the documents above, most programs at KTH require you to submit a\nsummary sheet, through KTH’s website, which is basically a form with some additional\ninformation about your academic curriculum.\nWith everything submitted, on February 1st, all that was left to do was to sit back\nand wait (for the next two months).\nIt was a long wait...\nFailed Side Quests\nIn an effort to decrease the total costs of this adventure, I decided to apply\nto two scholarships here in Portugal,\nPostgraduate Fellowships Abroad by the “la Caixa” Foundation and\nPrograma de Bolsas Huawei.\nUnfortunately, I did not pass the preselection stage for any of them,\nbut it ended up not being a huge problem since tuition is free in Sweden for\nEU citizens.\nAdditionally, while we were investigating KTH, we came across the CLUSTER\nconsortium, of which both IST and KTH are a part of (at the time of writing).\nWhen we were applying, there was a “Mutual Recognition of Titles” agreement,\nwhich stated:\n\n[…] students with a Bachelor degree from a CLUSTER university will be treated\nfor admission to a Master’s program in another CLUSTER institution in the same\nway as the local students of this institution. […]\n\nWe thought this could give us an advantage in the application, but after asking\naround, both at IST and at KTH, we did not get any satisfying response.\nTo further solidify the answers we got, it seems that this agreement has been\nwithdrawn from CLUSTER’s website since.\nDuring the month of January, I also started the application process to\nTU/Eindhoven, but I did not plan on submitting it until after KTH’s\nresults were out.\nThe Big Day\nWith the results publication day rapidly approaching, we were getting excited!\nOn the 15th of March, after 1.5 months of radio silence, the admission page\nchanged to show that we were conditionally qualified on one of our applications,\nmeaning all the documents were correct, but we still had to finish our bachelor’s.\nThen, the day after, the same thing happened to the other programme.\nIt was quite a relief seeing that we had done everything correctly, but we\nstill had 15 more days of waiting ahead of us.\n\n    \n  Our application with the status \"Conditionally Qualified\"\nThen, on the 28th of March, two days before the results, University Admissions\nstarted showing the message “YOUR APPLICATION IS LOCKED AS SELECTION IS\nCURRENTLY BEING RUN”. Nerves were racking up at this point, and I could\nbarely wait the remaining 48 hours.\n\n    \n  Selection being run at University Admissions, two days before the results publication\nFinally, the big day arrived. On the 30th of March, as I was taking the metro to go\nto university, at around 8:30 in the morning, I got a message from my friends saying\nthe results were out. I opened the University Admissions website, that I had been\nfuriously refreshing since I had woken up, and… nothing. It looked exactly the\nsame as last time. After a few moments of confusion and some messages back and\nforth, I realised that I had to log out and log back in to be able to see the\nresults. And sure enough, after I did that, I was presented with a wonderful\ngreen message saying “Conditionally Admitted”! Hooray!\n\n    \n  The application page after being conditionally admitted\nWith a huge sigh of relief, the three of us had been admitted to our first\noption!\nIn Search for Accommodation\nAfter the news wore off, we started tackling the task of moving to a new country.\nThis included flights (which we booked in April, and managed to get a pretty\ngood deal on the first flight, getting an executive ticket at the same price\nof the economy one, allowing us to take 2 checked bags plus a hand bag, which\nturned out to be immensely useful), but also finding a place to stay\nduring our studies.\nSince we were EU citizens, we could not get accommodation through KTH and instead had\nto find our own.\nTherefore, our first thought was to find a place for the three of us through\nthe private market, so we searched on Qasa, but, unfortunately, we could\nnot find anything that was both affordable and close to campus.\nFortunately, we had two other options that were geared towards students,\nAkademisk kvart and SSSB.\nWhile we did not explore the former a lot, we had actually created an account\nwith SSSB back in January, which offers unfurnished corridor rooms and apartments,\nso we were already accumulating credit days (up to a total of 90, which is the\nmaximum you can get without starting your studies).\nEven though signing up in January is more than enough to have the 90 days by\nthe summer, we later found out that the tie breaker seems to be when you signed\nup to the queue (I’m not actually sure, the wording on the website is a bit\nconfusing), so perhaps that turned out to be of great help.\nAround June, listings for corridor rooms started to show up on their website.\nSince we were allowed to pick 3 different rooms per booking period (which lasted\nabout half a week), we started by trying out various areas near KTH’s main\ncampus, but quickly realised it would be pretty difficult to get one that way.\nFor that reason, we experimented with applying for rooms a bit further away,\naround 25-30 min by metro from campus, and, surely enough, after a few tries\nwe all got one in the same building.\nRemaining Documents\nAfter finishing the bachelor, we had until the 31st of October to submit our\ndiploma (or equivalent). Anticipating the closure of the Graduate Area during\nthe first half of the month of August, we sent the requests right after we\ngot all of our grades on Fénix (IST’s learning management system), on the\n11th of July.\nFor future reference, the diploma is called “Certidão de Registo” (38€), but\nit takes about a year to be issued. Since we did not have that time,\nwe had to request a “Certidão de Conclusão” (60€), which has all the required\ninformation and is issued in a maximum of 90 working days, but can only be\nrequested alongside the aforementioned diploma.\nTo get these documents, one has to fill out R03 - Requerimento Registo de Grau\nas in the picture below, and send it to AG’s email address:\n\n    \n  R03 form filled out to get the required documents\nAbout a month later, on the 16th of August, I got the document I needed and\nsubmitted it to University Admissions, and, a few days later, my application\nstatus changed from Conditionally Admitted to Admitted.\nBye, Portugal\nFollowing a few days of packing and sobby goodbyes, we got on our plane\nto Stockholm.\nOnce we arrived, we picked up our keys at our house caretaker’s office (for which\nwe had scheduled an appointment beforehand) and went into our (very empty) rooms.\n\n    \n  Picking up our keys at SSSB\nThen, the day after, we went to KTH to get our accounts set up at KTH Entré.\n\n    \n  My first time at KTH, on a usual cloudy summer day in Stockholm\nThere are, obviously, a lot more stories to tell about the move-in process,\nand about my experience at KTH so far, but those will not fit into this blog post.\nFinal Thoughts\nAll things considered, I have to thank IST for unintentionally pushing\nme to pursue this amazing opportunity that I almost let through due to laziness.\nI have zero regrets of the choices that I made regarding my master’s, and I am\nenjoying my time at KTH and in Cybersecurity so far.\nFurthermore, I have to thank my friends and family for supporting me\nbefore, during and after the application process and this entire journey.\nAs a final note, if you, the person reading this, is in the same position as I\nwas a year ago and is applying to KTH, I hope that this post helped you and\nI wish you good luck in your application process.\nFeel free to get in touch if you have any questions and, if you get in, hit\nme up for some fika. 🇸🇪\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/ist-to-kth/","title":"From IST to KTH: How I Ended Up Studying Abroad in Sweden"},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/kalmarctf-writeup-nix-build-as-a-service/":{"body":"This is a write-up of the “nix-build as a service” challenge from KalmarCTF 2025,\na sequel to last year’s “Reproducible Pwning” challenge.\nTo get to the solution, we will take a peek behind the curtain into how Nix derivations\nwork internally.\nThe Challenge\nLet’s begin by taking a look at the challenge.\nWe were provided with a tarball, containing a flake and a Rust web app,\nand the following description, including some (very welcome) instructions for\nrunning it locally:\n\nReproducible pwning is back!\nThis time we learned our lesson and instead of full SSH access you can\nonly request building a derivation.\nSurely you won’t be able to leak anything this time?\nThe comments in the code could be rather helpful.\nEveryone gets their own instance for this challenge.\n[…]\nTo run the instance locally, unpack the handout and run nix run .#qemu.\nThe spawned VM will give you root shell access, as well as bind the web UI\nat localhost:8080.\n\nThe tarball contains the following files:\n\nNix Code\nStarting with flake.nix and base.nix, there isn’t much to see there apart from configurations\nfor properly setting up the VM, but the nix configuration stands out because it disables\nimport from derivation, which could restrict what we can do later:\n\nContinuing to the chall/ directory, we find a default.nix file that builds a derivation:\n\nAs mentioned in the challenge description, the comments indeed give various pointers of\nwhat we should do to get the flag.\nOne thing that I noticed immediately was the use of builtins.scopedImport.\nAlthough I had never seen it before, the name seems pretty self explanatory, and after\na quick search it seems like it is undocumented.\nIn a nutshell, it makes the attributes passed to it available in the scope of the\nimported file, shadowing any existing builtins.\nThe challenge used this to prevent the use of any builtins in user-input.nix,\nas we can see in the aptly named no-builtins.nix:\n\nI quickly checked if there were any builtins the challenge author had missed\nand found two (__convertHash and __warn), but they were not very useful.\nFun fact: you might be wondering why some builtins are prefixed by underscores.\nApparently, most (all?) builtins available under builtins that are not in\nthe global scope directly, are also available in the global scope but prefixed with __.\nAdditionally, they can also be used for overloading some operators.\nFor example, when doing a multiplication (a * b), Nix actually runs __mul a b\n(interestingly, this does not apply to sums with +).\nFinally, the chall/ directory also includes a chall.sh that is used to test\nthe solution (i.e., building the derivation) without having to go through the web app,\na user-input.nix that is effectively empty, containing only an empty attribute set,\nand perhaps most importantly, a flag.txt that contains the flag we want to get.\nIt is pretty clear from these files that the goal of the challenge is to provide a\nuser-input.nix that leaks the contents of flag.txt whenever the derivation in\ndefault.nix is built.\nWeb App\nThe Rust web app (under ui/) is not very interesting since it’s only used to interact\nwith the challenge, but introduces a peculiar limitation: only the last line of the\noutput of running nix-build is sent back to the user.\n\nHandout Update\nHalfway through the CTF, the handout was updated, nerfing the challenge a bit\nby adding the following to default.nix:\n\nMy solution requires this change, but the intended solution that\nwe will take a look at in a bit does not.\nInvestigating Attack Vectors\nNow knowing the challenge a bit better, we start to think how we can leak the flag.\nBriefly ignoring the limitation of not being allowed to use any builtins, there are two major ways.\nFirstly, derivations in Nix are usually built in a sandbox without network access.\nA notable exception are Fixed-Output Derivations (FOD), of which the cryptographic\nhash of the output is known in advance, and therefore can access the network to,\nfor example, download files.\nThey are commonly used in fetchers like fetchurl and fetchFromGitHub.\nUsing a FOD, we could perform a request to a URL we control, therefore sending the flag\nour way, since the hash is naturally only checked after the request is made.\nA practical example of this would be:\n\nAnother approach could be to instead take advantage of the web app by leaking\nthe flag directly or indirectly through the build log.\nUnfortunately, the log only contains the last line, which makes this a lot more\ndifficult.\nTo leak the flag directly, we would need to throw an evaluation error in the line\nabove the flag, since Nix gives some context around the error:\n\nThis could, in theory, be achieved by writing a Nix file and then importing it, like so:\n\nWhich outputs the flag in the last line when evaluated:\n\nHowever, in practice, this is not possible in the challenge because\nallow-import-from-derivation is set to false in nix.conf, as previously mentioned.\nFortunately, there is still the possibility of changing the build output depending on\nthe flag, even if the flag is not directly visible.\nThis is what I ended up doing for my solution, as you will see briefly.\nBut first, let’s take a step back and look at other limitations we still have to overcome.\nWhat is a Derivation?\nDepends on who you ask.\nLuckily for us, lib.isDerivation considers any attrset a derivation\nas long as it has a type attribute with value \"derivation\":\n\nTherefore, the first step in the solution is to pass that check in default.nix,\nwhich can be done by simply providing { type = \"derivation\"; } as input.\nGreat, the derivation now builds successfully!\n\nOkay, but really, what is a derivation?\nIf you have ever contributed to nixpkgs before, you might be used to\nstdenv.mkDerivation, or even language specific builders like rustPlatform.buildRustPackage.\nHowever, all of these derive from the derivation builtin, a function that\ntakes in an attrset and returns derivation (which, coincidently, is also an attrset).\nIn its most basic form, a derivation takes a name, a system type (e.g., x86_64-linux)\nand a builder (i.e., a program to run when the derivation is build).\nThere are other optional attributes you can set, but these are the minimum requirements.\nLet’s fire up nix repl and see what happens when we evaluate a sample derivation.\n\nNote: the repl does not print the contents of the underlying attrset of a derivation,\nbut if we trick it by changing the type to something else, we can peek into the\n“internals” of a derivation.\nWe can notice that the resulting derivation contains most of the information we would expect\ngiven what we provided, with some recursive attributes along the way (e.g., you can do my-drv.out.out.out\nuntil infinity).\nMost notably, it created a file in my Nix store, describing the derivation:\n\nIt has, however, not built it, since we have only evaluated it:\n\nThis behaviour was something I could not reproduce without the derivation builtin.\nMy initial idea was to create a derivation by hand, without using any builtins,\nand then have that, somehow, affect the build and leak the flag,\nbut I did not find a way for Nix to “regenerate” the .drv file from drvAttrs,\neven if the hash matched the expected value.\ntoString-ing\nRemember the change to the challenge that added a buildPhase to the derivation?\n\nIntuitively, we know that converting a derivation to a string will result in the\nstore path, but how does Nix know to do that?\nFrom what we have seen about the derivation, there is only one attribute containing\nthe store path, outPath, so it must be that one, but how does Nix know?\nWell, turns out it doesn’t, it just converts any attrset containing outPath to\nthe value of that attribute, recursively.\n\nThis is actually documented under the toString builtin, I just had\nnever stumbled upon it before.\nUsing this, it is possible to execute arbitrary bash code during the build process,\nsince the contents of outPath are not escaped:\n\nIf we build the derivation, we can see that we are indeed executing code:\n\nHowever, recall that we can only see the last line of the log, so this just by itself won’t\ngive us the flag.\nSide-channels\nThis is where side-channels come in!\nUsing the code-execution capabilities we just acquired, we can conditionally fail\nthe build, which is very much visible from the web app.\nOne example of this, is failing if the contents of flag.txt do not start with\na given string:\n\nThis piece of bash code will succeed if the flag starts with kalmar{, allowing\nus to retrieve the flag one character at a time with a simple Python script:\n\nNote: an interesting part of the web app is that it doesn’t pass\n--no-out-link to nix-build, which makes the build always fail since\nit does not have permissions to write the result symlink:\n\nThis is, however, still enough to differentiate between the two cases, since a build\nfailure returns something like:\n\nAfter waiting about 20 minutes for the script to run (it was pretty slow, but we had time),\nwe got the whole flag! 🎉\nIntended Solution\nAfter solving the challenge, I talked with the author niko, who\nshowed me the intended solution, which is arguably even more interesting and\nactually takes advantage of pkgs.hello in default.nix, unlike my solution\nwhich could work without it by making a slight modification.\nMore importantly, it works without the addition of the buildPhase nerf,\nthat is, it works with only adding the derivation to nativeBuildInputs.\nWithout further ado, this is the intended solution:\n\nLet’s now figure out why and how this works.\nWhen a derivation is added to nativeBuildInputs, mkDerivation will\ncall lib.getDev on it in order to get a store path suitable to\nadd to PATH.\nNotably, lib.getDev is simply an alias to lib.getOutput \"dev\",\nwhich are defined as:\n\nTo put it simply, lib.getOutput returns pkg.${output}\nif it exists, falling back to pkg.out and then to pkg.\nHowever, we can force it to always return pkg by setting\noutputSpecified to true in the attrset.\nSo, by setting outputSpecified we force the contents of\noutPath to be added to PATH (since, as we’ve seen, toString attrset\nreturns outPath if it exists).\nHowever, there is another way to control how an attrset is stringify-ed:\nby the __toString attribute, which is also documented.\nThis attribute takes a function, which receives the attrset being\nstringify-ed (i.e., itself) and expects a string to be returned.\nThis allows us to access the attributes in pkgs.hello, which conveniently\nincludes a call to fetchurl.\nThis is override-able through overrideAttrs to change the URL to one\nthat we control and to include the flag in the request,\nwhich achieves the first attack vector I mentioned earlier.\nTherefore, when the nixjail derivation is built, it triggers a\nrequest containing the flag. Neat!\nFinal Remarks\nI’m really loving these Nix challenges in CTFs, since they teach me a lot\nabout the inner workings of Nix, nixpkgs and NixOS.\nThis time, I learnt a bit more about how mkDerivation works under the hood, refreshed\nmy mind on the plain derivation builtin, and discovered new ways to change\nthe output of toString.\nBig kudos to niko and Kalmarunionen for putting out\nthis awesome challenge and CTF!\nI’m hoping to have more Nix challs next year as well 👀\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/kalmarctf-writeup-nix-build-as-a-service/","title":"KalmarCTF 2025 Write-up: nix-build as a service"},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/kalmarctf-writeup-reproducible-pwning/":{"body":"This is a write-up of the “Reproducible Pwning” challenge from KalmarCTF 2024.\nThis challenge takes us through the inner workings of Nix and a very interesting\nprivilege escalation that has made me change my own NixOS configuration.\n\nWhile I was already playing KalmarCTF, it was only after a Mastodon post that\nI noticed this Nix(OS)-related challenge, so thanks to jade for posting this!\nThe Challenge\nLet’s start by taking a look at the challenge.\nWe were provided with 4 files, a netcat command to spawn a new NixOS VM, and the\nfollowing description.\n\nI got access to this NixOS machine, but only as an unprivileged user.\nCan you see if you can find anything interesting?\nThe ISO provided runs the same config as the remote except for network\nconfiguration and how /data is mounted. The flag is at /data/flag.\n\nThe given files were a flake.nix, a flake.lock, a nix.patch and\na nixos.iso (which was not actually a disk image; more on that later).\nWe can start by taking a look at the flake.nix file, which has some interesting\nsections:\n\nAs we can see, there are two important things happening in this NixOS configuration:\n\nThe Nix version is being overridden (through an overlay) to Nix 2.13(.6);\nTwo extra options, extra-sandbox-paths and build-users-group are being passed\nto the nix-daemon. We will delve into the implications of these options later.\n\nTo get the whole picture, let’s now take a look at the patch that is being applied\nto Nix:\n\nIt seems like it is blocking a few options from being set, namely build-hook,\npost-build-hook, pre-build-hook, accept-flake-config, allow-new-privileges\nand impure-env, which gives us a hint that we might want to play around\nwith options in this challenge.\nFinally, we take a look at the nixos.iso file.\nSurprisingly, the file was quite small, so it certainly couldn’t be a disk image.\nInstead, it was a Git LFS file:\n\nI spent way too long figuring out what to do with this and how to use it to download\nthe ISO, only to realise I didn’t have enough information to download a file from Git LFS,\nsince I was missing the repository name.\nUpon further inspection of the flake we were given, I noticed it outputs an iso\npackage that we can build (duh).\nBy running nix build .#iso and waiting a few minutes for Nix to compile, I got\nthe ISO and unsurprisingly the hash matched what was in the Git LFS file (hurray\nfor reproducibility!). Nice.\n\nInvestigating Attack Vectors\nWith all the files inspected and (moderately) understood, it was time to figure out\nwhat to do with all the information I had.\nAs a sanity check, the first thing I did was checking if the flag was somehow stored\nin the Nix store, but it was not.\nI then decided to take a look at the Nix 2.13.6 code, more specifically into the\nnix-daemon code.\nA quick clone of the repository and grepping for nix-daemon directed me to the\nsrc/nix/daemon.cc file, which seems to contain the logic for starting the daemon\nand listening for incoming connections on its Unix socket.\nI am not very proficient with C++, so it took me a while to figure out everything\nthat was going on, but I eventually found the daemonLoop function that\nis responsible for accepting new connections and determining if they come from a\ntrusted user or not.\nOne part of that function that immediately stood out was this block of (disabled) code:\n\nIt does seem like at some point this code was introduced to prevent running nix-daemon as root\nif build-users-group is empty, but it was disabled 16 years ago because apparently it\nbreaks RPM builds. 🙃\nThe comment in the code clearly states this is very dangerous 👻, so this was definitely\nthe right track.\nUpon opening the nix.conf(5) man page, we can read the description of the build-users-group\noption (emphasis mine):\n\nThis options specifies the Unix group containing the Nix build user accounts. In multi-user\nNix installations, builds should not be performed by the Nix account since that would allow users\nto arbitrarily modify the Nix store and database by supplying specially crafted builders; and\nthey cannot be performed by the calling user since that would allow him/her to influence the build result.\nTherefore, if this option is non-empty and specifies a valid group, builds will be performed under\nthe user accounts that are a member of the group specified here (as listed in /etc/group).\nThose user accounts should not be used for any other purpose!\n[…]\nIf the build users group is empty, builds will be performed under the uid of the Nix process\n(that is, the uid of the caller if NIX_REMOTE is empty, the uid under which the Nix daemon runs\nif NIX_REMOTE is daemon).\nObviously, this should not be used with a nix daemon accessible to untrusted clients.\nDefaults to nixbld when running as root, empty otherwise.\n\nSo it seems that since build-users-group is empty, builds will be performed by the root user,\nwhich, by default, is a trusted user in the eyes of the nix-daemon.\nPutting together all the puzzle pieces, I realise that the nix-daemon is exposed inside\nthe build sandbox at /tmp/daemon because of the aforementioned extra-sandbox-paths option,\nwhich means we can get trusted access to the nix-daemon!\nTurning on the VM\nTo test this theory, I tweak the flake.nix a bit to set a password for both the root and user\nusers and enable SSH access for root.\nThis allows me to access logs from the nix-daemon, which prints a message\nevery time a connection is initiated, indicating whether the user is trusted or not.\nTurning on the VM with QEMU and SSH’ing into both users, I upload a simple flake that contains\na derivation that opens a connection to the nix-daemon socket during build.\n\nBy building this package using the user user, with nix build .#exploit,\nwe can see in the nix-daemon logs (journalctl -xefu nix-daemon from the root user)\nthat the build is indeed running as the root user!\n\nEscaping the Sandbox\nNow that we have validated that the build indeed runs as root and that we have\ntrusted access to the nix-daemon, we need to find a way to escape the build\nsandbox, since the /data directory is not exposed inside it.\nMy first thought was to take a look at the available operations exposed by the nix-daemon\nand figure out if I could send a specially crafted payload through the socket\nthat would allow me to get the daemon to copy /data/flag into the (world-readable)\nNix store. However, I was deterred by my poor understanding of C++ and by trying\nout the experiment locally on my laptop through nix-store --add, which promptly ruined\nthose plans:\n\nI briefly looked at the daemon code to understand if this was being checked on the\nnix-store command or on the daemon, but from my (limited) understanding of the code,\nit seems like the nix-daemon only receives the data to be added to the Nix store\nand not a file path, which means it is responsibility of whoever is connecting to the\ndaemon to read the file.\nBummer.\nHaving hit a dead end, I decided to search for “privilege escalation” in the Nix\nrepository’s issue tracker which yielded\nan interesting comment about running commands as root without password.\nIf you are not aware, this is the same problem as using Docker while having your user\nas a member of the docker group: it allows for passwordless privilege escalation\nthrough a daemon running at root.\nThis is apparently a conscious design decision of both Docker and Nix, and is clearly\npointed out in their respective documentation.\nUnfortunately for us, the given example in the issue is using post-build-hook,\nwhich is disabled in the challenge due to the patch that has been applied to Nix.\nHowever, the idea remains, and two possible paths forward pop in my head:\n\nSince it is possible to control the options passed to nix build,\ncould we take advantage of our trusted user privileges to build a\nnew derivation that would escape the sandbox?\nIs it even possible to build a derivation inside another derivation?\nThe aforementioned issue also mentions that, once you are a trusted user,\nyou are able to “access or replace store path contents that are critical for\nsystem security”, which gave me the idea of trying to change the nix-daemon\nconfiguration to include /data in the sandbox.\n\nBuilding a Flake Inside a Derivation\nWith both of these ideas in mind, I started with the first one and built\na small flake:\n\nThis flake gets the flag from /data/flag and places it in the derivation\noutput. It also prints it to stdout, which should allow us to get the\nflag as well if it works.\nAs we are now a trusted user, we are able to pass certain options to the daemon,\none of which is sandbox-paths, which allows us to specify which paths\nwill be exposed inside a sandbox.\nWith this in mind, we simply build this inner flake from inside the other one\nwe already had by changing the installPhase:\n\nAs a result, we end up with the following file structure:\n\nI had high hopes for this strategy, but upon copying the files to the VM\nand building the flake, I got the following error message.\n\nIt appears that the flake is copied to the nix store (the folder does indeed exist\noutside the sandbox), but the sandbox does not allow the builder to access it,\nso we get this error.\nAt this point I gave up trying to get the derivation build to work and started looking\ninto the second attack vector, modifying the Nix store.\nLittle did I know how close I was…\nModifying the Nix Store\nAs mentioned previously, my goal for modifying the Nix store was to change the\nconfiguration of the nix-daemon, more specifically the file that contained\nthe extra-sandbox-paths configuration:\n\nIf I could change that file to include the /data directory in the sandbox,\nI would be able to get the flag from inside the derivation,\nand according to the previously mentioned GitHub issue, this is possible.\nUnfortunately, after spending way too long trying to figure out a way to\noverwrite files in the store, I did not get anywhere, even though there is\nlikely something that I missed.\nAs I already had this file in the Nix store of my own laptop from\nbuilding the ISO, I tried to somehow tamper with it.\nSadly, my experiments were fairly limited since I am not very knowledgable with\nthe commands used to interact with the store.\nAs a result, my plan for tampering this would be to copy the file to\na temporary Nix store, modify it, and copy it back.\nTo achieve this, I firstly created a new directory /tmp/store and\nused nix copy to populate the store with our target file:\n\nThis works as intended, which means I went ahead and edited the file, taking\ncare to add write permissions beforehand and removing them afterwards:\n\nFinally, I (tried to) copy it back to my own store:\n\nThe command did not output anything, but checking the file in the store reveals\nthat it has not been changed:\n\nRunning the nix copy command with -vv reveals that 0 files were copied, presumably\nbecause it already exists in the destination.\nI tried a few flags such as --repair and --refresh, but none of them helped.\nAfter some rubber duck debugging with my teammates, I decided to abandon this\neffort and go back to exploring the idea of building a derivation inside a derivation,\nbut this time without using flakes.\nBuilding a Package inside a Derivation\nThis ended up being pretty similar to my previous attempt, since the only\ndifference is the lack of flakes, which meant I had to go back and\nremembered how to not use flakes.\nAfter some time searching, I ended up with the following nix file:\n\nIt is now possible to build this from the outer flake,\nwhile making sure to pass it the path to nixpkgs, which\ncannot otherwise be found by nix-build:\n\nCopying these files to the VM and building the derivation gives\nus the flag! 🎉\n\nI was still not happy since I wanted to have the flag be placed in the output\nof the derivation, but it appears there’s an error related to copying it to the\noutput folder.\nTurns out this is the same problem as I was facing with the flake: the path the\nresult symlink points to (/nix/store/34arwa2ixqh46sc9v3gksgiglxpmzfll-exploit-inner)\nexists, but it is inaccessible from inside the sandbox.\nThis can be quickly fixed by copying the symlink itself to the output folder,\ntaking care to pass the --no-dereference to cp to preserve the symlink\n(i.e., cp --no-dereference result $out).\nAs a result, the exploit can be reduced to simply two files and two commands:\n\n\nBeautiful.\n\nFull exploit files\n\n\n\nIntended Solution\nAfter talking with the challenge author, niko, I was made aware\nthat there were two intended solutions, and neither of them included the use\nof sandbox-paths (or disabling the sandbox completely).\nThe first one (and easiest) was to instead use diff-hook to run code as root\nin a similar fashion to the forbidden post-build-hook.\nThe second one was to leverage read-write access to the Nix store as root to edit\nsome critical files in the system, similarly to what I tried to (unsuccessfully)\nachieve.\nLet’s take a look at both of them and how they could be used.\nAbusing diff-hook\nAfter taking a look at the manual for diff-hook,\nit looks like the “diff hook is executed by the same user and group who\nran the build”, which in our case means the root user.\nAdditionally, it appears that this hook is not run inside the sandbox,\nwhich means it has access to the flag.\nThis diff-hook is executed when the output of the same derivation differs\nfrom a previous build, with the goal of calculating the differences\nbetween the two builds (hence the name).\nTherefore, to take advantage of diff-hook, we need to build an unstable\nderivation, that is, a derivation that doesn’t always produce the same output.\nAn easy way to achieve this is to read from /dev/random and write it\nto the derivation output, as such:\n\nWith our unstable derivation at hand, we can now build it twice,\nmaking sure to tell Nix to rebuild the derivation a second time\nwith the diff-hook and to check it against the previous build\nwith the --check option, otherwise it would just realise it had\nalready been built and do nothing.\nOur specially crafted diff-hook simply copies the flag, which\nit has access to, to a different file that is readable by the\nnon-root user.\n\nAs expected, building the derivation copies the flag to /tmp/flag:\n\nAbusing Read-Write Access to the Nix Store\nThis second strategy was pretty much what I wanted to do during the CTF,\nbut didn’t manage to.\nHowever, with more time, a fresh mind, and the assurance that it actually\nworks, I tried to simply write to a file in the Nix store from inside\nthe derivation and it actually works!\nOne small caveat is that you must be able to reference the file from\nyour derivation, so that it is included in the sandbox, but that is no problem\nfor the various packages in nixpkgs.\nMy first instinct with this new ability was to override the nix.conf configuration\nand add /data to the sandbox, just like mentioned previously.\nHowever, this does not work since someone would have to restart nix-daemon,\nand the only user with the permissions to do so would be root.\nAnother prime target for modifications is any kind of setuid binaries, such as\nsudo.\nWhile sudo has been disabled in this system, many other setuid binaries are still\navailable, as we can see by taking a look at the /run/wrappers/bin directory.\n\nRealistically, any of these could be chosen, since they all run as root,\nbut for the purpose of this example I am going with su, which is provided\nby the shadow package (as shown by a quick readlink $(whereis su)).\n\nWith this in mind, we can now change our derivation to override the su\nbinary with a custom binary that just prints the flag.\nTo achieve this, we can copy our malicious binary over the su binary\nin pkgs.shadow.su (su is the output of the shadow package that\nactually includes the su binary).\nInitially, I used a simple bash script that would just cat the flag, but\nLinux ignores the setuid bit on all interpreted executables,\nwhich meant the script did not run as root and failed to print it.\nFor that reason, we can resort to a simple C binary that does the same thing.\n\n\nAnd we got the flag again! 🥳\nFinal Remarks\nI enjoyed this challenge a lot and I’m looking forward for more Nix-related challenges\nin future CTFs.\nDiving inside Nix’s inner workings has made me grasp a better understanding of how\nit all works, and it has even made me remove myself from the trusted-users\nin my own systems.\nFurthermore, I was suspicious of the use of such an old version of Nix (2.13), but I replicated\nthe three exploits in Nix 2.18.1 (the “default” for the pinned commit in the challenge)\nand they worked flawlessly.\nAs final acknowledgements, I have to thank jade for the initial\nMastodon post, niko for making this awesome challenge,\nand my teammates for the rubber duck debugging during the CTF.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/kalmarctf-writeup-reproducible-pwning/","title":"KalmarCTF 2024 Write-up: Reproducible

side channels on the web, which allow\nus to infer information which we otherwise would not have access to.\n\nThis class of vulnerabilities is called Cross-Site Leaks (or more commonly, XSLeaks),\nand, sorry for the spoiler, is what we will be taking advantage of in order to get\nthe flag.\nThis write-up will be an insight into how I approached this problem and successfully\nsolved it, taking way more time than I would like to admit.\nWith that said, there is a lot of Minesweeper gameplay ahead of us, but first, we have\nto dissect the source code that is given to us.\nThroughout this write-up, the URLs of the challenge and the attacker-controlled website\nare referred to as https://gosweeper.example and https://attacker.example respectively.\nThe Challenge\nLet’s start by taking a look at the challenge, which provides us with a zip file and\na challenge URL.\nUpon loading the URL, we are greeted with a landing page where we can either login or\nregister.\nClicking the register button immediately creates a new user and shows us its ID\n(a 128-bit hex string).\nGoing back to the landing page reveals a counter of games won (along with total games),\nas well as a play button.\nStarting a new game reveals a 7x7 board without any initial discovered tiles, as well\nas two buttons under it, “Check win” and “Admin check”.\nEasy enough, I thought, I have played a lot of Minesweeper before.\nAfter playing a few games, I came to the conclusion that guessing the first tile correctly\nis quite difficult, and winning the game is borderline impossible, since there are multiple\n50/50 situations.\nAdditionally, there seemed to be a lot of mines, more than you would expect for a board that\nsmall.\n\n    \n  Top left: landing page; Top center: register success page; Top right: logged-in home page; Bottom: board page\nHaving gotten a grasp of the web interface, it is now time to look into the source code\nthat was given to us.\nExtracting the zip archive reveals that it contains a Docker setup (thanks) and a\nGolang application consisting of a single Go file and multiple HTML templates.\n\nI have to preface the rest of this write-up by saying that I have little to no experience\nwith Golang, but the challenge code is quite easy to read, and fortunately no weird\nGo shenanigans were required (I’m thankful for sane languages sometimes; looking at you\nJavaScript).\nMy first instinct when approaching web challenges with source is to grep for the flag,\nwhich usually gives us a very good overview of the direction we need to take.\nThis challenge is no different, and we found the following in the Go file:\n\nIt seems like the flag is shown in the home page once we reach 20 perfect wins,\nwhich as mentioned before, is borderline impossible by just playing the game.\nGreat.\nAfter quickly going through the source code, I found two important pieces of\ninformation: how the board is generated and what the “Admin check” button does.\nThe function that generates the board is quite long, but here is a small recap\nof the algorithm:\n\nRandomly pick a position on the board to be the first bomb.\nPick another random position on the board, and if is next to a bomb (orthogonally;\ndiagonally does not count), place a bomb there.\nRepeat the previous step until half of the board is composed of bombs, that is,\nuntil there are 25 bombs in the board.\nMark all safe spots neighboring more than 6 bombs as bombs as well (for sides\nthe threshold is more than 3 bombs, while for corners it is more than 2),\npreventing a single safe spot surrounded by bombs.\n\n\nFull board generation code\n\n\nThis results in the following game mechanics:\n\nBombs make up 50%-60% of the board;\nThe center of the board is nearly always a bomb;\nThere is usually a “safe” side, where the bombs don’t spread to;\nAll the bombs are connected to each other, which means there are no bombs\nisolated from the rest of the bombs (this helps decisions on 50/50 situations\nwhere one option could have never been generated by this function);\nThere can, however, still exist safe spots isolated from each other.\n\nThese mechanics will be important in the future, so keep them in mind.\n\n    \n  Admin X-ray view, where it is possible to see the board without solving it\nFinally, before delving into the exploitation of this app, let’s take a look\nat what the “Admin check” button does.\nWhen clicked, it creates a new admin account and invokes a headless Chromium\nbrowser that performs the following actions:\n\nLogin as the admin\nSleep for 1 second\nClone the board of the user\nSleep for 1 second\nOpen the board of the user with the xray option (shows where the bombs are)\nSleep for 4 seconds\n\n\nAdditionally, further inspection of the clone endpoint reveals that each board\ncan only be cloned up to 5 times, which is reset when a new game is started.\nThis gives us a very strong hint that we must somehow take advantage of the bot\nto extract information about our own game.\nInvestigating Attack Vectors\nNow that we have an overview of the challenge, we need to figure out which\nattack vectors exist.\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS)\nScrolling through the code, the first thing that catches my attention is this\nmiddleware setting certain security headers.\nInterestingly, the CSP header seems to be commented out, so I thought there\nmight be some kind of XSS that we have to exploit.\n\nHowever, it seems like the challenge author was just lazy (or wanted to throw us off),\nbecause looking through the HTML templates did not show anything promising.\nThere doesn’t seem to be any variable that we control; the only data we can directly change\nis the board itself, which is encoded as an integer array, meaning there is no way to\ninject a string there.\nServer-Side Template Injection (SSTI)\nSince there were HTML templates involved, I then looked into the function that handles\ntheir rendering, hoping to find a vulnerability there.\nWhile it seemed secure at first glance, as I am not very experienced with Go I looked\nup SSTI examples in Go to make sure it was sound.\n\nSimilarly to XSS, there doesn’t seem to be anything exploitable here, since we don’t\ncontrol the templateFile variable.\nRedirect Middleware\nHowever, one middleware caught my attention, since it handles user input.\nThis middleware is responsible for redirecting the user, upon login, to the link\npointed by the redirect query parameter.\nThis means that the URL https://gosweeper.example?redirect=/board would redirect\nany logged in user to /board.\n\nAs we can see from the code, there are certain checks in place to make\nsure this is either a relative URL or an absolute URL matching the challenge\norigin (i.e., gosweeper.example).\nDespite this, it is still possible to bypass these protections, since browsers\ninterpret an URL starting with double slashes as absolute, but it does not\nhave any scheme (i.e., its scheme is inferred from the scheme of the current\nwebsite).\nFor this reason, the URL https://gosweeper.example.com?redirect=//attacker.example\ncauses a redirect to https://attacker.example.\nNow we just need to find a way to take advantage of this behaviour…\nAdmin Bot\nFurther inspection of the aforementioned admin check feature reveals that we control\npart of one of the URLs the bot (headless Chromium browser) visits.\n\nThe endpoint accepts a cloneid parameter given in the POST request’s body,\nwhich if empty just defaults to the ID of the current user.\nThis parameter is then passed as a query parameter to a URL the bot visits,\nbut with no escaping whatsoever.\nThis means that we can pass additional query parameters (e.g., the aforementioned\nredirect parameter) and get the bot to visit our own website, simply by sending\ncloneid=something&amp;redirect=//attacker.example in the body of the request.\nWe can see this in action by sending a request using the following code in the\nbrowser’s console (or using your favourite HTTP client) and taking a look at the\nheadless Chromium’s logs:\n\n\nIt is also worth noting that, as evidenced by the request to /newboard,\nthe board isn’t being cloned, since the redirect middleware runs before the\nactual endpoint handler.\nTaking Control of the Admin Bot\nNow that we can get the bot to visit our website (at least for 1 second), we\nneed to figure out what to do with this capability.\nThere are multiple interesting pieces of information that would be helpful\nto get ahold of, such as the bot ID (which has unlimited X-ray access) or the\nboard in the X-ray view.\nUnfortunately, there are various countermeasures put in place (mainly by the browser)\nto make sure we cannot access this information:\n\nNo Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) header is present, which\nmeans that, while we are able to make requests to https://gosweeper.example,\nthe browser does not allow us to read anything from the response\n(including its status code);\nAdditionally, the cookie’s SameSite attribute is unset, which\ndefaults to Lax.\nThis means that while we can make requests, they will be unauthenticated, which\nis rather useless.\nThe only requests that are authentication are top-level navigations, that is,\nchanging the page URL to that of https://gosweeper.example/...;\nOther security headers are also present, such as the\nCross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP) header and the\nCross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP) header.\nThe former prevents an attacker from opening a pop-up and keeping a reference\nto its window object, while the latter prevents any webpage from loading\nresources from the challenge’s origin (e.g., images).\nNone of these cause significant headaches, since for the former the browser\nalready prevents cross-origin accesses to the DOM, and for the latter\nthe lax cookie policy prevents the cookies from being sent at all.\n\nFortunately for us, there is still something we can use to make authenticated\nrequests to GoSweeper, even if we cannot (directly) obtain any information:\nwindow.open.\nWhile on a user-controlled browser pop-ups are blocked by default, on headless\nChromium they are allowed, so we can open as many new tabs as we want.\nThis is useful, for example, to actually clone the board, which only requires\na GET request.\nThe following attacker payload would result in getting the bot to clone the board\nas it was supposed to do before we forced a redirect, since it opens a new tab\n(top-level navigation) which includes the authentication cookie.\n\nAlternatively, and perhaps more flexibly, we can also use HTML forms, which\nallow us to do POST requests as well.\nAs such, the example above can be rewritten as (notice target=\"_blank\" in the\nform HTML to open it in a new tab):\n\nWe can see from the browser logs that the bot indeed successfully clones the board,\nsince the request to /board?xray=1 no longer redirects to /newboard!\n\nNow that we have successfully cloned the board, while still having an open tab\nwith our malicious website open, we can try to make certain requests in order\nto hopefully extract information about the state of the board.\nGiven that all traditional methods of getting information (e.g., sending a request\nusing fetch) are blocked, we are left with just one option: side channels.\nXSLeaks\nAs previously mentioned, side channels on the web are commonly referred to as\nCross-Site Leaks (XSLeaks), and they allow an attacker (us) to infer information\npresent in another origin (GoSweeper).\nGoing through the XSLeaks Wiki reveals a number of approaches one could take,\nwhich mainly rely on having the website and/or browser exhibit\ndifferent behaviour based on the state of the board.\nTo take advantage of this, we first need to find a scenario in which a request\nis handled differently depending on certain actions.\nThe challenge gives us the hint that we might not be able to get the whole board\nat once, since we are limited to 5 clones per board.\nTherefore, it is likely that we will only be able to infer whether a certain\ntile is a bomb.\nUpon inspecting the source code again, and recalling the already observed\nbehaviour, the /board endpoint stands out as a good candidate, since it causes\na redirect to /newboard if there isn’t an active game (i.e., right after\nwe lose).\nThis redirect behaviour can be detected by\nexhausting the browser’s redirect limit, which will cause an error\nif /board redirects, but proceed normally otherwise.\nMore concretely, the Chromium browser has a limit of 20 redirects (in one go);\nif we perform 19 redirects somewhere else and then redirect to /board, we\nare able to know if the logged in user has an active game or not.\nFor this side channel to be useful, we first need a way to manipulate the state\nin a way that will give us relevant information.\nTo achieve this, we can make a guess on a tile (using the /guess endpoint):\nif that guess is a bomb, the game will end and the bot user will not have\nan active game anymore; otherwise, the tile will be revealed and nothing else\nwill happen.\nUsing this, we now have a clear way to figure out whether a given tile is a bomb\n(i.e., an oracle).\nSo, recapping the plan:\n\nClone the board using the admin bot;\nMake the bot take a guess on the tile we want to reveal;\nMake the bot navigate to the board page and detect whether there is an active\ngame, revealing the contents of the guessed tile;\nSend this information back to us.\n\nThese are a lot of actions to take in just one second (and the redirects, especially,\nseem to take a lot of time to execute in the headless browser), so we need a way\nto persist after that.\nThankfully, this is not very difficult, since we can just open a new tab from\nthe initial page, giving us another 4 seconds until the browser is killed:\n\nSince we are doing further requests mutating the state of the board, we need to\nwait for the /board?xray=1 request to be sent first, otherwise it would generate\na new board if the tile we are guessing is a bomb, rendering the side channel useless.\nMy first approach for this was to use setTimeout, waiting a certain number of milliseconds,\nbut this proved to be quite unreliable, since the time the new tab takes to load can vary.\nTo combat this problem, I injected an event handler in the “main” tab that would tell\nthis new /persist.html tab that it was navigating somewhere else\n(i.e., the deprecated unload event).\nThis is only possible because both pages are from the same origin (i.e., https://attacker.example),\nso window.opener in the second tab points back to the first one and is able\nto interact with it.\nAs such, this is what our persist.html looks like now, making a guess on tile 0 (the top-left corner)\nafter the bot navigates away from its opener:\n\nAgain, looking at the headless Chromium bots reveals that this is working as intended, with the\nrequest to /guess being sent immediately after the one sent to /board?xray=1.\n\nThe only thing left now is to detect whether there is still an active game after making\nthe guess.\nSince we cannot use fetch, given that it would not include a cookie, we have to rely\non opening a new tab once again.\nHere, an interesting behaviour emerges: if we reach the maximum number of redirects,\nthe window’s origin will be about:blank, which is accessible from any origin;\notherwise, the origin will be https://gosweeper.example and we will not be able\nto access any content of the window.\nTherefore, to know if a redirect is successful or not, we just have to poll\nthe w.window object and check if it becomes null; if it does, we have lost access\nto the window reference, meaning the redirect was successful (and there is no bomb).\nIn order to achieve the 19 redirects (well, 18, since opening the new tab also counts\nas a redirect, apparently) before the final destination, we can use\nXSLeaks’ own demo service, which provides us with the\nhttps://xsinator.com/testcases/files/maxredirect.php?n=18&amp;url=&lt;url&gt; endpoint\n(I’ve tried creating my own with Caddy, but it ended up not being reliable in the\nchallenge’s instance).\n\nNotice some optimisations that were made in order to make sure we always™ get the\ncorrect result:\n\nA new tab is open as soon as the page is loaded, even before the window.opener.onunload\nevent handler is fired, in order to reduce the time it takes to initiate the request of\nthe redirects;\nThe redirects are slow, so starting them at the same time as the guess is not a problem\nand also helps with making sure it finishes within the 4 seconds that we have;\nWe first wait 2.5 seconds after sending back the status of the window, but in some cases\nthis might not be enough time for all the redirects to finish, so we keep sending requests\nat 100ms intervals afterwards (until the browser process is abruptly terminated).\n\nThis correctly identifies whether the tile is a bomb.\nHere is a log of the request in case of a bomb:\n\nAnd here is the same thing when it is a safe spot:\n\nAwesome! Now we just need to put this together to be able to quickly know\nwhether any tile of our choosing is a bomb.\nTying It All Together\nTo more efficiently trigger the bomb oracle, we can create a Node.js app using\nExpress and Mustache that receives the tile to be explored through the\nredirect, and prints the outcome of the callback:\n\n\nMustache templates\ntemplates/entry.mustache:\n\ntemplates/xsleaks.mustache:\n\n\nThis application allows us to redirect the bot to https://attacker.example/entry/&lt;tile&gt;,\ntriggering the XSLeaks exploit, which will (eventually) print out “safe” or “bomb”.\nFinally, since sending these requests manually would be tiring, we can declare a\nJavaScript function in our browser’s console that simply takes the index of the tile\nwe want to reveal and sends the appropriate request:\n\nRunning oracle(0) should, within about 10 seconds, tell us whether the tile\non the top-left corner is a bomb, printing this information to to the terminal\nrunning our Node.js application.\nPlay Strategies\nAs you might recall, in order to get the flag we need to get 20 perfect games,\nwhich would be easy to do using the oracle in combination with some automated\nsolver.\nHowever, I was too lazy to implement one, so I ended up playing the 20 games by\nhand, which took way too long, but was definitely faster than trying to\nimplement a solver for it.\nHere are some strategies that I adopted:\n\nFirst, I made a drawing of the board with the tile numbers, which made it\neasier to use the oracle on the correct tile without having to count each time;\nSecond, it is possible to restart the board whenever we want, by calling the\n/newboard GET endpoint, without it incurring a loss, which is useful for when\nthere is a 50/50 and we are out of oracles (recall that we have 5 per game);\nThird, I always start with the top-left corner and restart the board if it is\na bomb, maximising the number of available oracles throughout the game;\nFourth, it is important to keep in mind the aforementioned peculiarities\nof the board generation function, which help on certain 50/50 situations.\n\nUsing these strategies, it is quite easy to get the 20 wins, even if it takes\na while.\nBelow is a sample gameplay:\nSample gameplay animation using the oracle for tiles 0, 6, 42, 45 and 40\nAfter repeating the process 20 times, we get the flag on the home page:\n\n    \n  The homepage showing the flag after winning 20 out of 20 games\nFinal Remarks\nSolving this challenge makes us take a deep dive into navigation-related\nside channels on the web, inferring information that would otherwise\nnot be possible to extract.\nEven with all the sandboxing built into the browser, it is still not\nenough to properly isolate different origins from each other.\nWhile I hit many road blocks while trying to solve this challenge, it ended\nup being very fun, and I definitely have deepened my knowledge in XSLeaks.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/openecsc-round2-writeup-gosweeper/","title":"openECSC 2024 Round 2 Write-up: GoSweeper"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1029/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/collabora-nextcloud-nixos/":{"body":749,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/hello-world/":{"body":69,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/immich-docker-to-nixos/":{"body":289,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/ist-to-kth/":{"body":1498,"title":7},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/kalmarctf-writeup-nix-build-as-a-service/":{"body":986,"title":7},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/kalmarctf-writeup-reproducible-pwning/":{"body":1543,"title":6},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/blog/openecsc-round2-writeup-gosweeper/":{"body":1799,"title":7}},"length":9},"lang":"English"};
